## Multiclass perceptron approach

We have seen so far that we can use a vector of weights $\bf{w}$ and a bias $b$ to make a binary classifier based on a hyperplane. Points that are on one side of the hyperplane are 0 points that are on the other side are predicted as 1.

What happens if we want to make a model that separates among N regions (N classes)?

One possible solution is to use a prototype based approach using a Multiclass perceptron model
